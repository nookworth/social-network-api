# Social Network API

This project contains working API routes as a back end for a social network. The routes are divided into two subcategories: user routes and thought routes.

The user routes include creating a new user, displaying all users, adding friends to a user's friend list, updating a user's information, and deleting a user.

The thought routes include allowing a user to post a new thought (in the form of text), updating a thought, adding a reaction to their own or somebody else's thought, deleting a thought, and deleting a reaction.

MongoDB is the database for the project and the routes utilize mongoose.js.
